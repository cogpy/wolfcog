## Usage

### Complete Bootstrap Sequence

```scheme
;; Load the multi-stage orchestrator
(load ".guix/bootstrap/multi-stage-bootstrap.scm")

;; Run complete 4-stage bootstrap
(complete-wolfcog-bootstrap)
```

### Individual Stages

```scheme
;; Run specific stage combinations
(run-stage0-only)    ; Stage 0 only
(run-stages-0-1)     ; Stages 0-1
(run-stages-0-2)     ; Stages 0-2

;; Or run stages individually
(let* ((stage0-result (stage0-bootstrap))
       (stage1-result (stage1-bootstrap stage0-result))
       (stage2-result (stage2-bootstrap stage1-result))
       (stage3-result (stage3-bootstrap stage2-result)))
  (complete-bootstrap-report stage0-result stage1-result stage2-result stage3-result))
```

### Interactive Commands

```scheme
(bootstrap-info)  ; Show available commands and stage descriptions
```

## Bootstrap Stages

### Stage 0: AGI-OS Initialization
- Initializes Guile environment with core packages
- Detects and configures Wolfram kernel pools
- Verifies OpenCog Unified System components
- Presents bootloader configuration interface
- Applies Guix-inspired security mechanisms

### Stage 1: Cognitive Platform Loading
- Loads advanced CogUtil (enhanced logging, pattern-matching, memory management)
- Initializes distributed CogServer (RPC, message passing, load balancing)
- Sets up hypergraph AtomSpace (parallel processing, advanced queries)
- Mounts advanced ASFS (real-time sync, access control, caching)
- Establishes inter-component bridges (event bus, data flow optimization)

### Stage 2: Adaptive System Activation
- Activates full system integration (cross-communication, resource sharing)
- Starts symbolic evolution engine (pattern recognition, evolutionary operators)
- Enables cognitive feedback loops (self-monitoring, meta-cognition)
- Launches adaptive attention allocation (dynamic focus, salience calculation)
- Initializes controlled self-modification (code generation, safety constraints)

### Stage 3: AGI Emergence & Self-Modification
- Enables autonomous evolution (advanced mutation, coevolution)
- Activates meta-learning (algorithm selection, transfer learning)
- Initializes autonomous goal generation (intrinsic motivation, curiosity)
- Sets up creative reasoning (analogical reasoning, conceptual blending)
- Launches AGI emergence coordination (multi-modal reasoning, emergent behavior monitoring)

## Testing

```bash
# Run bootstrap tests
python3 test-bootstrap.py

# Test specific functionality
python3 -c "
from test_bootstrap import BootstrapTest
tester = BootstrapTest()
tester.test_multi_stage_structure()
"
```

## Architecture

Each stage builds upon the previous stage's results:

```
Stage0 → Stage1 → Stage2 → Stage3
  ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
 Init   Platform Adaptive  AGI
                          Emergence
```

The multi-stage orchestrator coordinates execution and provides comprehensive reporting of the entire bootstrap sequence.

## Safety Features

- **Stage 2**: Controlled self-modification with safety constraints
- **Stage 3**: Adaptive safety mode with human alignment preservation
- **All Stages**: Comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms

## Development

The bootstrap stages are implemented as Guile modules with proper export declarations and inter-stage data passing. Each stage can be developed and tested independently while maintaining integration with the overall bootstrap sequence.
