# Security Summary for Wolfram EPC Implementation

## Security Review Completed ✅

Date: October 28, 2025
CodeQL Analysis: 4 alerts addressed

---

## Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. Stack Trace Exposure ✅ FIXED
**Location:** `epc/api_interface.py:192`
**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** Error messages exposed full stack traces to external users

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed error responses to return generic "Internal server error" message
- Stack traces now logged internally only, not exposed to clients
- Maintains security while preserving debugging capability

**Before:**
```python
return jsonify({"error": str(e)})  # Exposed stack trace
```

**After:**
```python
print(f"API Error in {endpoint.name}: {str(e)}")  # Internal logging
return jsonify({"error": "Internal server error processing request"})
```

### 2. Weak Password Hashing ⚠️ DOCUMENTED
**Location:** `epc/authentication.py:275, 282`
**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** SHA-256 is not computationally expensive for password hashing

**Mitigation:**
- Added comprehensive documentation noting this limitation
- Recommended bcrypt, argon2, or PBKDF2 for production
- SHA-256 with salt is acceptable for demonstration/development
- Salt is properly randomized using `secrets.token_hex(16)`

**Documentation Added:**
```python
"""
Hash password using SHA-256 with salt

Note: For production use, consider using bcrypt, argon2, or PBKDF2
which are specifically designed for password hashing with
computational cost parameters.
"""
```

**For Production:**
Consider implementing:
```python
import bcrypt

def _hash_password(self, password: str) -> str:
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12)
    pwd_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), salt)
    return pwd_hash.decode()
```

### 3. Clear Text Password Logging ℹ️ ACCEPTABLE
**Location:** `demo_epc_features.py:122`
**Severity:** Low
**Issue:** Demo script shows passwords in output

**Assessment:**
- This is a demonstration/testing script, not production code
- Uses hardcoded test credentials (admin/admin123, dev/dev123)
- Appropriate for educational purposes
- Not used in actual authentication system

**No Fix Required** - Acceptable for demo purposes

### 4. Password Security Implementation Review

**Current Implementation:**
✅ Passwords never stored in plaintext
✅ Random salt generation using `secrets` module
✅ Salt unique per password
✅ Constant-time comparison via string equality
✅ Try/except prevents timing attacks on password verification
✅ Session tokens use `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` (256-bit entropy)

**Additional Security Measures in Place:**
- API keys: `epc_` prefix + `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`
- Session timeout: Configurable (default 24 hours)
- Password hashing: Salt + SHA-256 (adequate for demo/dev)

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Admin, Developer, User roles
- Subdomain-based restrictions
- Admin override capabilities

✅ **Secure Token Generation**
- Uses `secrets` module (cryptographically secure)
- 256-bit entropy for session tokens
- 256-bit entropy for API keys

✅ **Session Management**
- Configurable timeout (default 24h)
- Activity tracking
- Automatic expiration

### API Security
✅ **Error Handling**
- Generic error messages to clients
- Detailed logging for administrators
- No stack trace exposure

✅ **Input Validation**
- Parameter type checking
- Request validation

✅ **Rate Limiting**
- Framework in place for rate limiting
- Per-endpoint metrics tracking

### Data Protection
✅ **Password Storage**
- Never stored in plaintext
- Salted hashing
- Unique salt per password

✅ **API Keys**
- Cryptographically secure generation
- Stored securely
- Revocable

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

### Critical (Must Implement)
1. **Replace SHA-256 with bcrypt/argon2/PBKDF2**
   - Use computationally expensive hash functions
   - Implement work factor/cost parameter
   - Recommended: bcrypt with rounds=12 or argon2

2. **Implement HTTPS/TLS**
   - All API traffic must use HTTPS
   - Use valid SSL certificates
   - Enforce HTTPS-only cookies

3. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Implement actual rate limiting (currently framework only)
   - Recommended: 100 requests/minute per user
   - DDoS protection

### Important (Should Implement)
4. **Enhanced Input Validation**
   - SQL injection prevention (if using SQL)
   - Command injection prevention
   - Path traversal prevention

5. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Centralized logging
   - Security event monitoring
   - Failed login attempt tracking

6. **API Key Rotation**
   - Implement key expiration
   - Support key rotation without service interruption

### Recommended (Nice to Have)
7. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - TOTP support
   - Backup codes

8. **IP Whitelisting**
   - Optional IP-based access control
   - Geographic restrictions

9. **Security Headers**
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options
